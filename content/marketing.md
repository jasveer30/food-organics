As my venture is organic food restaurant so the major segment is going to be the senior people who are already facing that problem of obesity and vegan people who do not like eating meats. We will try to make our grip over the youth segment as well by telling them the benefits of eating healthy food and disadvantages of heavy calories food making then obese in earlier age. we will target every individual or grocery stores where people can buy products made by our restaurants.

How will we reach out to your customers for marketting?                                                              

i think social media is a best way to reach people ,so we will be distributing small flyers with the weekly newspapers as well as we will use Facebook ,insatgram etc to get more and more people in our restaurants. For example we are getting regular flyers from food basics ,Canadian tire and metro so they are doing this just to increase the ,market for their business .with the flyers they gave specific dates or the sale like 2 for 1 ,20% discount store wide .Tim Horton's 2 for $5 sandwich. Banners on the road side  is also a good idea.

 What are our strategies to secure, serve, and retain? 

To make a secure position like MacDonald and Tim Horton's we will concentrate on food quality and quick service ,cleaning all these basic factors help us to make a secure position in the market of competition because on the flip side just selling organic can't help us to make a secure place we will have to take several other factors into the consideration of committee. for the fast serving we will hire experienced and active staff with good communication skills to provide unforgettable experience to our customers. Furthermore to retain or  maintain on that good position where you have 100% customer satisfaction and Good profit we will follow proper guidelines that are made to follow for everybody to setup new business and to run smooth functioning of the business.

 How will our venture sell its product and develop customer relationships?

 To sell our products we will do proper use of mass media to reach people and time to time taking something new to keep our customers always exited .however to develop good relationship with the customers we will do online survey on our website and in return with the survey code provide special meal offers to customers in this way we will get feedback direct from the customers and make improvements also.
