      # "**_Grow ORGANIC to achieve excellence in agriculture and commerce,
      protect the environment and enhance community well-being"_**


      **Eating as an experience**


      "THE new Canada's food organics serve healthy  ,rich in fiber and vitamins
      and fat free good to save people from the chronic diseases like cancer
      ,obese ,liver problems and high blood pressure.


      Though this may seem impractical for many Canadians rushing between jobs
      and other obligations, the new Canada Food organics is aligned with our
      emerging desire to ‘take a beat’ and savor experiences and each other –
      despite the manic pace of our lives. The way we define wellness, for
      instance, is increasingly relative to things like ‘quality time with the
      people I love’ or ‘work life balance.’ The emergence of at-home meal kits
      as one of the fastest-growing segments in the Canadian marketplace is also
      testament to this trend, with more and more Canadians opting for the
      experience of their meal over the convenience of take-out.


      What does this mean for brands? As Canadian consumers make trade-offs
      between time and experience, it’s important for brands to be aware of the
      occasions and new rituals that are (or are not) open to their products.
      The Meatless Monday movement, for instance, is an example of a social
      trend that provides an ideal connection for meatless and vegetarian foods
      to shine – and for meat brands to acknowledge.


      **Wellness as a human right**


      Unlike its predecessor, the new Canada Food organics is conscious of the
      fact that nutritious choices are often a privilege. The recommendation,
      for instance, to reduce processed food intake is framed by a cost
      argument, while food literacy and food planning are explained as
      cost-control measures. In its long form, the guide even highlights how
      cost is a very real barrier to eating well for Indigenous and elderly
      populations.

      The recognition of dollars as a determinant of food choice and, in turn,
      health, is aligned with our changing perception of wellness as a
      privilege. Gone (or going) are the days of Goop-like health ideals or
      “Wellness for the 1%.” Instead, the Global Wellness Institute has
      championed the notion of wellness not as a luxury item, but a fundamental
      human right.


      What does this mean for brands? From fashion to fitness, food and more,
      brands that aren’t mindful of cost as a barrier to the aspirations they
      espouse, risk coming off as tone-deaf, or worse. Want to connect with the
      masses? Consider how your brand can offset the worry of wellness coming at
      a high expense. One example is including ‘price per serving’ on the label,
      not just the nutritional information.


      **Eating as an environmental choice**


      Also newly introduced into the Guide is the potential impact our food
      choices have on the environment, emissions and our food supply.


      This environmental consciousness mirrors a growing mindset in Canada that
      goes beyond the “reduce, reuse and recycle” mantra of the 90s. Being green
      is no longer just about what we put in the bin, but what we put in our
      bodies, with more people viewing their choices as directly linked to the
      wellness of their communities and the planet as a whole. Plant-based diets
      are being popularized as environmental choices, not just personal ones.
