Project risk management is an important aspect of project management. Project risk is defined by PMI as, "an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives.

_**" Risk: The likelihood that a project will fail to meet its objectives.**_

my venture is to starting a chain of organic food restaurants in Canada to overcome the sever chronic diseases happening due to bad food quality. According to my venture the maj

or risk to my project is marketing because of the lower demand of the product because of the cost of the organic foods which is higher than other food products or ingredients in the market.

Financial risk: - finance can be a biggest risk for my venture because according to our assumption team in the initial five years in of the food will be low as compare to the other food points in Canada like competing MacDonald in not a cup of tea which anyone could have.so we will have to wait for five years to at least reach the profit level of renewed food organization.

Buying the material from the market can be very expensive for us till the time outflow are more than inflow. we need big amount to buy the stuff in bulk. On the other side we will need to know first about the taxation that may apply to our business, and how we can manage them.

Unavoidable legal risk: - opening a food restaurant is directly concerned with the lives of people. So we need to get the federal, provincial/territorial and municipal permits and licences that is needed to open a new business and an approval for land from government will be our biggest concern. Furthermore, we will have to get unique business number for our restaurant in Canada. whereas on the same time, we will have to buy space to open restaurants after that we will register it and get approve then only we can open it. 

Food safety: Getting information on food safety, like allergies and how to handle specific safety issues. We will have to give training session to our team members which can be expensive for us because it will be a free training sessions for the employs which is eventually costly for us and after that to make sure they are following the rules made for environmental public health.

Risk of failure: - even though we will hire experienced chef and other team member as well but still in food restaurant if the quality of food ever gone low or bad then the chances of restaurant failure are always there.

Risk of stock and quality maintained: as the project is quietly different rather than just opening a restaurant because getting pure organic products is something very challenging because before buying we will have to make surprise testing technique which is time consuming as well as expensive and in Canada due to the problem of snow we may have to get several products from other countries which is again expensive if its from the country like USA .ensure the quality before serve will be more important than others because its going to be pure organic means no pesticides 

**How can we reduce these risks**

Answer: According to my research and knowledge, the only and best strategy to reduce ant kind of risk related to food project is to just provide best training and doing feedback sessions for your team members to make sure they are following all the food safety and quality rules for 100% customer satisfaction. Now What this strategy will do? it will help us to mitigate the major risk for our restaurants which is failure of restaurant. If we will get any problem with the quality of food we will definitely eliminate that issue completely by getting new machines, hiring more experienced people and following proper cleaning rules. with these things managers are also responsible for conducting regular training sessions on proper lifting and carrying techniques for heavy items. We will hire the Employees who know how to interact with customers should understand how to resolve problems. For example, if a customer is dissatisfied with a meal, your employee should know what to offer the customer to solve fix   inconvenience they have faced, and when to get the manager involved.

We will make online surveys to provide the best services to our customers, to do this customer feedback is only source we have to make improvements. we will make several food plans, discounts, rewarding system to make customer experience most rewarding experience.

For this project it is not possible to accept the risk if we do that we might get the punishment from facilities because of playing with the lives of people and we might have to close the restaurants or gave to penalty in millions of dollars
